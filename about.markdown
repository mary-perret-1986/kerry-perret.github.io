Hi I'm Kerry (Mackenzie) Perret, I'm a XX-yo Software Developer, currently based in Paris and working at [Veepee](https://veepee.com).

I like:
- (⚠️spoiler-alert) coding 💻
- debating using the principle of charity ⚖️
- learning stuff 📚
- self-deprecating humor 🙈
- terrible puns 😹
- Guinness 🍺🍀
- the damp weather ⛈️
- almost all sorts of food,🤤 preferrably Asian cuisine 🥢🍜🦐🍛🥔
- taking sh*te 🖼️ with my 📱📷
- travelling 🧳🗺️🧭 even if it means `carbon footprint++;` ✈️🚆🚴‍♀️

and... not necessarily in that order.

If you believe that my free will is an actual thing (⚡huge premise here), then the opinions expressed on this "platform", are, supposedly, solely my own.
