# Me(h)ow-dy y'all! 🐱🐮

I am Natalie, a Software Developer 👩‍💻 currently based in Paris and working @ [Veepee](https://www.veepee.com). I talk and write about work, legal stuff, ethics, mental health, and software development.

Oh and I occasionally write [some bad random blog posts here on this blog](https://natalie-o-perret.github.io) rumbling about all kinds of things, often plagued with typos🖊️, unapologetically in, plain, broken English,📚 sprinkled with an unreasonable amount of commas.
