A relatively long time ago 📅, in a not-so-far-away galaxy 🌌 an acquaintance of mine challenged me to start writing something like a personal journal 📖, and quite frankly, for some reason I can't even fathom now, I couldn't really help but to accept that challenge ✅. 

And here it is, how I pretty much ended up creating this diary-slash-blog thingy 🤔.

I am now trying to live up to my very own words 💬, like some sort of grown-up woman 👵. Though, I can't really promise writing on a regular ~~daily, weekly, monthly,~~ bi-annual(❓) basis (is that really a thing? Well, I guess it is now). Regardless, I've found the practice of my broken 🩹 writing style 🖋️ interesting nonetheless.

Also, I like the idea of sharing some ahem-teresting video 🎞️ at the end of each post, so there's that too.
