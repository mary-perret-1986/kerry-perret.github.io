### 2021: Taking Over

I took over the lead of a team with a particular setup:
- 3 Software Integration Specialists (SIS), also endorsing some support duties.
- 1 Product Owner (PO).
- 1 Co-op student (dev).
- 1 Lead Developer (LD), myself, "semi-managing" the co-op dev.

The scope of the team was quite peculiar in many ways:
- In the past, I have always worked in team where the topology was either:
  - 1 PO + 1 LD + N devs
  - 1 LD + N devs
  - 1 PO + N devs
- I never had to work with SIS / Support in the same team before, I sure had to do some (dev) support in my past experience, but never I had like 

The scopes (in the context of a e-commerce company) and the different solutions we initially had:
- Trading (Accounts Payable): the short-term debts / obligations the company owes to its suppliers
  - A staffing solution
  - A propriatary OCR solution
  - An invoicing platform 
- B2B (Accounts Receivable): the money that customers owe to the company for goods or services that have been delivered but not yet paid for.
  - Immaterial Sales
    - KYC
    - Cashouts
  - Travel Sales
    - Staffing

### 2022: Adding Another Scope

Indirect Procurement: acquiring goods and services that are not directly tied to the products being sold but are essential for running the business (unlike Merchant / Direct Procurement).

The solutions I inherited with this particular scope:
- Another invoicing flow working with propiatary Software-as-a-service (SaaS).
- A flow for processing journal entries / accruals

### 2023: Scope getting smaller, except for devs

### 2024 and beyond: Restructuring and Top Priority
