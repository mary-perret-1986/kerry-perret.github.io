      <description>Why starting from scratch again? State of the Affairs: 2020 - 2023 I used to have only two articles on this very same blog for the past 2-3 years, without much activity.
Part of this was due to personal reasons and particularly health concerns (I had to undergo a dozen of surgeries over a two years time period). And another (bad) reason was that I used to want to make things always picture perfect, but oftentimes people like to swing like a character trait is just a trait without thinking much and discarding actual root causes.</description>

      <description>Who am I? I am Natalie Perret, a Software Developer, currently based in Paris and working @ Veepee.
I like to talk and write about mental health, work, and software development.
Some additional bits about myself I am working with F#, C# (marginally), TypeScript and Rust (with parsimony) stuff at work. I am currently learning Rust (cause I am clearly not an expert), Go (re-learning it cause I wanna help with it at work), TypeScript (not doing great) and Zig (my own quirks).</description>
