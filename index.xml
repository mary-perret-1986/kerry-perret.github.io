      <description>A Sensible Set of Writing Guidelines: Distilled Conciseness? Given how my brain works, I needed to come up a simple set of rules to become more productive when writing blog articles.
Topic Scoping Scoping is often key in writing and one practical way to enforce that, is to be as concise as I can and that involves using the most accurate terms to limit the number of words needed to convey.</description>

      <description>State of the Affairs: 2020 - 2023 I had only two articles on this blog for the past 2-3 years, with very limited activity, if almost none at all.
Part of this was due to personal reasons, I was busy to say the very least: Spending time taking care of long-lasting health concerns. I have undergone a dozen of procedures, some were elective, some others were really not. I had to do what was needed for myself.</description>

      <description>Who am I? I am Natalie Perret, a Software Developer, currently based in Paris and working @ Veepee.
Some additional bits about myself I like to talk and write about mental health, work, and software development. I am working with F#, C# (marginally), TypeScript and Rust (with parsimony) stuff at work. I am currently learning Rust (cause I am clearly not an expert), Go (re-learning it cause I wanna help with it at work), TypeScript (not doing great) and Zig (my own quirks).</description>
