State of the Affairs: 2020 - 2023 I used to have only two articles on this very same blog for the past 2-3 years, without much activity.\nPart of this was due to personal reasons and particularly health concerns (I had to undergo a dozen of surgeries over a two years time period). And another (bad) reason was that I used to want to make things always picture perfect, but oftentimes people like to swing like a character trait is just a trait without thinking much and discarding actual root causes. I have never been huge on: One particularly downside of going at such great lenghts, is that I used to get lost into details. It was not only due to sheer perfectionism, per se. but also internal struggles, some of them were tied to what you would call “mental disorder”. But, sometimes, mental disorders are not just environmental or there just because of poor upbringing but because of biological / biochemical reasons. I have matured a lot about the few bits I have written about before, and it would be lying to say that I can still can recognize who I was then when writing those articles. I feel like I was a lot more childish and insecure than I am now, that’s for sure. But still, I wanted to write more, and share more, not only for others, but also first and foremost as a very self-serving act, for myself. Not necessarily to practice my writing skills, but also to keep track of what I have learnt, what I have been through.\nComing up with a Sensible Set of Blogging Guidelines: Distilled Conciseness? Due to how my internal cognitive processes and thoughts work, I needed to stick to some framework (of mine) that fits my own peculiar mindset and limit the things I want to do with this blog.\nTopic Scoping I think scoping is the key for me. I am, by nature, very insecure about not doing enough, and most people who know me, would say that I am often going the extra mile(s), even when there is objectively nothing at stake. Always scared of not doing enough due to the fear of rejection and the lack of proper self-esteem. One way to address the point above is to be as concise as I can, and to be nice with myself (only a handful of people on Earth know that typing those words is actually taking some efforts, there is a lot of self-loathing). Split as many necessary individual and mangeable chunk-sized topics as possible, if the topic I am tackling starts gets too big, i.e., avoid dwindling in the weeds. Avoid Emojis whenever they don’t bring conciseness I.e., when they have not been clearly defined.\nEmotions and Representations In my experience, I have found that emojis are not only often poorly used, but also quite often misunderstood. It is often cumulative and pervasive, they tend to build up.\nI think the statement particularly holds true for emojis that intend to convey emotions, such as “😏”, “😉”, “😆”, “😅”, “🤐”, “😏”, “🙄”, “🫣”, “🤨”, “😠”, “🥹”, “😣”, “😖”, “😞”, “😡”, “🤬”, “😤”, 🤷‍♀️\", etc. (some of which I use extensively myself but get easily triggered when I do not know intinmely how somebody else is using them), because of what I have mentioned earlier: the fear of rejection, ultimately, but also because it can be confusing to the other person and to others.\nEverybody is unique in their own way, so is their communication. Of course, I have my own bias of inscure woman who has some degree of PTSD. And for what it is worth, it goes both ways, as someone sending a message, but also as a person receiving a message with emojis.\nYou never really know the background of the people you are interacting with (unless they are your very close ones).\nI think there is a lot of internal and deeply personal representation associated to images and hence emojis. For example, the way we smile, laugh, is not something universal, it is not cutural, it is local to your life experience which is unique. Some people might take them more seriously than others depending on a wide variety factors, can be things like relating to one’s psyche like self-confidence, but also vision impairement, etc.\nWhat about objects? Putting aside the well known things that can allude to sexual connmotations, I think they are fine, (also if there are things defining / explicitign their meaning so that they aren’t too vague nor too distractive), as long as mentionned earlier they can bring conciseness, it all boils down to just this eventually.\nActual conciseness Words can also suffer from the same indirection, but clearly not to the same extent. Besides, there are at least dictionaries with usually wiledly acknowledged consensus when it comes to their definitions (personal usage it’s still whole another thing, i.e., words are not perfect).\nMaximize Insightfulness Digging into an article a post takes time, I think another solid piece of guideline for me is to maximize the benefits someone (including myself) can get out of an article, if any (your mileage may vary, taste is not accounting).\nI do not like the idea of someone spending more 5-10 min of their time going through an article.\nIterate and allow yourself to make some mistakes If it does not feel right, think Agile (without all the globeydook), I am not saying your corporate Agile coach. I don’t think Agile is like for everything, it’s okay for IT projects for which the dynamics are okay given the userbase and the stakeholders, but I think the iterative process might shine even more when it comes to writing.\n","wordCount":"958","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2020-08-14T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2020-08-14T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://natalie-o-perret.github.io/posts/0-blogging_a-brand-new-start/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"🐈Natalie Perret🍫","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://natalie-o-perret.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://natalie-o-perret.github.io/ accesskey=h title="🐈Natalie Perret🍫 (Alt + H)">🐈Natalie Perret🍫</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://natalie-o-perret.github.io/about title=About🆔><span>About🆔</span></a></li><li><a href=https://natalie-o-perret.github.io/search/ title=Search🔍><span>Search🔍</span></a></li><li><a href=https://natalie-o-perret.github.io/tags/ title=Tags🏷️><span>Tags🏷️</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class=post-title>📝 Blogging: A Brand New Start 🛣️</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2020-08-14 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>August 14, 2020</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min</div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=#why-starting-from-scratch-again aria-label="Why starting from scratch again?">Why starting from scratch again?</a><ul><li><a href=#state-of-the-affairs-2020---2023 aria-label="State of the Affairs: 2020 -
