Everybody has different communication styles and it can be hard for two people to be on the exact same page. Especially if they haven't got the chance to mingle with each other for long enough prior to them interacting.

There are many factors that can make communication between individuals challenging, i.e. different backgrounds, cultures, and upbringrings, etc. I thought it could come in handy to have a page sharing my "communication style", inc. my emojis.

For example, throughout my career, I had people who resp. told me that:
- I'm too straightforward and transparent
- I'm passive-agressive
- I'm "shy"
- I'm too verbose and detailed
- I'm way too blunt and outspoken
- I'm politically correct
- I'm overly apolegetic
- I'm not fun, I'm too serious and boring
and despite the fact that I've probably changed, at least a bit over the last decade or so, I'm a tad skeptical that it's only on my end that things have changed. After all, don't we say that "beauty is in the eye of the beholder".

Well you see, interpretation depends greatly on a lot of parameters, context, interlocutors, how close you are with them, suffice to say, there isn't a one-size-fits-all solution, there will be faux pas whether you want it or not. 

# My🐈 Communication💬 Style👩‍🎨

I'm someone who is usually seen as blunt (tho, like I mentionned above, some people have very different takes or opinions about the way I express myself), speaking unreservedly her mind in all kinds of circumstances, which depending on the audience can be seen as something really off-putting and well, plain --wrong-- or inapropriate (but I would still argue that it is actually a good thing, whether the people see it that way or not). 
- 99% of what I'm saying can be taken at face value, no questions asked.
- I use double quotes (i.e. `"`) whenever I'm not sure if I'm using the right word or symbol or if it's really appropriate. 
- I use double dashes around words (i.e. `--`) to put emphasis certain concepts that seem relevant and important to what I'm talking about.
- If I want to say the opposite, on very  rare occasions I can use several double quotes (`"""`), for instance 'It's """red"""' 
- When I'm asking about something in an excited manner (this often happens when I'm really confused or in WTF moments), I use the interrobang `‽` / `!?` / `?!`, etc. or I just use "WTF", "WTAF", "OMGWTF", etc.

Mostly applied to work and casual conversations (with some notable exceptions, I'm not yet a machine, and arguably a biological one), not necessarily to blog posts.

I have hard times interpreting: 🙂, 🙃, 😁, 😆, 😉, 😩 and a bunch of others.

Actually, I do like [the concept of tone tags](https://toneindicators.carrd.co), but:
1. I'm far from being an expert about them
2. Alas, I think most people are completely foreign to them

Other concepts I have in mind when communicating (or at least I'm trying to the best of my capability):

- [Empathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy)
- [Active listening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_listening)
- [Principle of Charity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_charity)
- [Hanlon's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor)
- [Sutor, ne ultra crepidam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutor,_ne_ultra_crepidam)
- [Dunning–Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect)
- [Power structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_structure)
- [Law of Jante](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Jante)

Last but not least, I'm always trying to make not only my own premises as clear as possible, but the ones of my interlocutors as well. 

You would be surprised how often people think they are debating when they just can't. When your "[axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom)" are so fundamentally different from the ones of the persons you're talkin to, there is very little chance you can reason with them.

Axioms are far too often granted to be the same of both sides of a conversation, and based on my experience, usually they're not quite the same. Clarifying positions right from the get-go avoids wasting time on things you can't really agree on.

Reminds me of Wednesday in American Gods season 2, Episode 4, entitled "The Greatest Story Ever Told": 

> I have **a piece of paper**. But I want **this salt shaker**. **You have** the salt shaker, but **you’re willing to take my piece of paper for your salt shaker**. 
>
> Now, why would you do that? Because this isn’t actually a piece of paper, **it's a story**. And the story that you’ve heard over and over and over again. And it's been drummed into you that this is worth something, **this is of value**. 
>
> No matter what country, **culture**, or **religion**, the whole **world loves money**. 
>
> **The greatest story ever told**.
