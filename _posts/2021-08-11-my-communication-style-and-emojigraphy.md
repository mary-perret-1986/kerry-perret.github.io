Everybody has different communication styles and it can be hard for two people to be on the exact same page. Especially if they haven't got the chance to mingle with each other for long enough prior to them interacting.

There are many factors that can make communication between individuals challenging, i.e. different backgrounds, cultures, and upbringrings, etc. I thought it could come in handy to have a page sharing my "communication style", inc. my emojis.

For example, throughout my career, I had people who resp. told me that:
- I'm too straightforward and transparent
- I'm passive-agressive
- I'm "shy"
- I'm too verbose and detailed
- I'm way too blunt and outspoken
- I'm politically correct
- I'm overly apolegetic
- I'm not fun, I'm too serious and boring
and despite the fact that I've probably changed, at least a bit over the last decade or so, I'm a tad skeptical that it's only on my end that things have changed. After all, don't we say that "beauty is in the eye of the beholder".

Well you see, interpretation depends on a lot of parameters, context, interlocutors, how close you are, suffice to say, there isn't a one-size-fits-all solution, there will be faux pas whether you want it or not. 

# My🐈 Communication💬 Style👩‍🎨

I'm someone who is usually seen as blunt (tho like I mentionned above, some people have very different takes or opinions about the way I express myself), speaking unreservedly her mind in all kinds of circumstances, which depending on the audience can be seen as something really off-putting and well, plain --wrong-- or inapropriate. 
- 99% of what I'm saying can be taken at face value, no questions asked.
- I use double quotes (i.e. `"`) whenever I'm not sure if I'm using the right word or symbol or if it's really appropriate. 
- I use double dashes around words (i.e. `--`) to put emphasis certain concepts that seem relevant and important to what I'm talking about.
- If I want to say the opposite, on very  rare occasions I can use several double quotes (`"""`), for instance 'It's """red"""' 
- When I'm asking about something in an excited manner (this often happens when I'm really confused or in WTF moments), I use the interrobang `‽` / `!?` / `?!`, etc. or I just use "WTF", "WTAF", "OMGWTF", etc.

I have hard times interpreting: 🙂, 🙃, 😅, 😁, 😆, 😉, 🤣, 😇, 😩

Actually, I do like the concept of tone tags (https://toneindicators.carrd.co), but:
1. I'm far from being an expert about them
2. I think most people are completely foreign to them
