Everybody has different communication styles and it's hard to find a common ground that is good enough for every one of us (i.e. different backgrounds, cultures, and upbringrings, etc.). I thought it could handy to share with you my "communication style", inc. my emojis.

Throughout my career, I had people who told me that:
- I'm too straightforward and transparent
- I'm passive-agressive
- I'm too "shy"
- I'm too verbose and detailed
- I'm too blunt and outspoken
- I'm too politically correct
- I'm not fun, I'm too serious and boring

It depends on a lot of parameters, context, interlocutors, how close you are with them, suffice to say, there isn't a one-size-fits-all solution, there will be faux pas whether you want it or not. 

# My🐈 Communication💬 Style👩‍🎨

I'm someone who is usually seen as blunt (tho like I mentionned above, some people have very different takes or opinions about the way I express myself), speaking unreservedly her mind in all kinds of circumstances, which depending on the audience can be seen as something really off-putting and well, plain --wrong-- or inapropriate. 
- 99% of what I'm saying can be taken at face value, no questions asked.
- I use double quotes (i.e. `"`) whenever I'm not sure if I'm using the right word or symbol or if it's really appropriate. 
- I use double dashes around words (i.e. `--`) to put emphasis certain concepts that seem relevant and important to what I'm talking about.
- If I want to say the opposite, on very  rare occasions I can use several double quotes (`"""`), for instance 'It's """red"""' 
- When I'm asking about something in an excited manner (this often happens when I'm really confused or in WTF moments), I use the interrobang `‽` / `!?` / `?!`, etc. or I just use "WTF", "WTAF", "OMGWTF", etc.

I have hard times interpreting: 🙂, 🙃, 😅, 😁, 😆, 😉, 🤣, 😇, 😩

Actually, I do like the concept of tone tags (https://toneindicators.carrd.co), but:
1. I'm far from being an expert about them
2. I think most people are completely foreign to them
