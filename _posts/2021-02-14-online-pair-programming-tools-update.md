# Why?
It happens that when going through interview rounds, your interviewers are perhaps curiously and ironically not really ready... for testing your coding abilities 👩‍💻!

For example, they would like to proceed to some sort of online🌐 pair programming but they are doing it the wrong way, like asking you to code directly on Skype (be in in the message box or via a sharing screen feature). You may think I am cracking a joke😹, well it did actually happen quite a few times to me🤦‍♀️, so better be prepared! Not only coding in the Skype message box💬 is more error-prone for you as an interviewee... but it is also the case for your interviewer as well!🤕

It can also occur that you would like share some code ideas in an interactive fashion✍️.

Either way, it's always nice to have something working out-of-the-box⌨️, saving you a lot of time⏱️ and hassle🤕.

# (Some) Available Solutions

- [Codeshare](https://codeshare.io): just an online notepad... no autocompletion or running capabilities.
- [CoderPad](https://coderpad.io): non-free but provides running and (some) autocompletion capabilities.
- [CodeBunk](https://codebunk.com): same as [CoderPad](https://coderpad.io) but with slightly more options (alas, except the autocompletion)
- [CodeInterview](https://codeinterview.io): akin [CodeBunk](https://codebunk.com) with better and sleak UI.

Although they are not free (unless you wanna spend your time creating multiple accounts to keep benefiting from the free trial stuff), I usually go with either [CodeBunk](https://codebunk.com) or [CodeInterview](https://codeinterview.io), since they both provide everything I need to assess🧪 the candidates I'm interviewing👩‍💻:
- Both platforms record coding interview sessions, it's good for multiple reasons:
  - I can step back and resume at a later point in times, it gives a more "nuanced vision👓" of what happened during the interview process. 
  - As an interviewer, you might also be rushed⚡ by other things at work, be it before the interview or even during the interview⏲️. As such your ad-hoc perception of what happened during the interview might be a tad biased. 
  - Review what did work✔️ and what didn't❌ (including my own faux pas😳).
  - Ask around for feedback, and see if whether I've been too harsh😡 or conversely overly nice🧸 with the candidate.
- I don't really need auto-completion🤏, the reason is, I let candidates google everything they need and the coding interview is bts rather a good excuse to discuss their thought process along with asking them a bunch of tech. questions on the relevant topics. I make sure that the candidates I'm interviewing are always at ease☮️ with me. 
- The thing you really don't want to happen during an interview is to have your candidate stressing out! Speaking of which, I don't really get why the "bad cop 👮 + good cop👮‍♀️" style of interview is still so prevalent in IT (but hey I don't get to decide about every single thing in our whole damn world🗺️, please, next time, 🗳️"Vote Kerry"👩). 
- Anyhoo, there are still plenty of other things I don't really get about "our industry"💻🏭 and this might be very much for another post📝.
